# Purpose of This Repo

In this project, student will implement two of the main components of a traditional hierarchical planner: the behavior planner and the motion planner. Both will work in unison to avoid static objects parked on the side of the road, preventing collision with these objects by executing either a “nudge” or a “lane change” maneuver, navigate intersections, and track the centerline on the traveling lane.

This repo contains completed code for `Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Planning Project`


## Result on CARLA
